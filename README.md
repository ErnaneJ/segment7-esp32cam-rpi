# ESP32-CAM to Raspberry Pi Digital Multimeter Reader üì∏üî¢üîç

This project integrates an ESP32-CAM with a Raspberry Pi to read and interpret digital displays from a multimeter, enhancing visibility and publishing data to a broker.

## Overview

The ESP32-CAM captures images of a multimeter's 7-segment display, serving them over HTTP using its IP address. The Raspberry Pi then processes these images:

1. **Image Capture**: ESP32-CAM captures images of the multimeter's display.
2. **Image Processing**: Raspberry Pi receives images, enhances them for readability, and performs OCR using Tesseract to extract digits.
3. **Data Interpretation**: Recognized digits are processed, interpreted, and published to a broker (e.g., MQTT) at regular intervals.

## Hardware Setup

- **ESP32-CAM**: Captures images of the multimeter's display.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Receives images from ESP32-CAM, processes them, and publishes data.
- **Multimeter with 7-segment Display**: Source of digital readings.
- **Internet Connection**: Required for ESP32-CAM to serve images and Raspberry Pi for data processing.

## Software Requirements

- **ESP32 Arduino Library**: Required for ESP32-CAM image capture.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing library on Raspberry Pi.
- **Tesseract**: OCR engine for digit recognition.

## Installation and Setup

### ESP32-CAM Setup

1. Flash the ESP32-CAM with the provided Arduino sketch.
2. Update WiFi credentials (`WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS`) in the code.
3. Ensure ESP32-CAM is powered and connected to the network.

### Raspberry Pi Setup

1. Install OpenCV and Tesseract on Raspberry Pi.
2. Clone and compile the provided Raspberry Pi image processing script.
3. Configure script to subscribe to ESP32-CAM's image stream and publish results to the MQTT broker.

### Running the System

1. Power on ESP32-CAM and Raspberry Pi.
2. ESP32-CAM serves images over HTTP.
3. Raspberry Pi captures, enhances, performs OCR on images, and publishes data to the MQTT broker.

## Example Usage

1. Access ESP32-CAM's image feed via `http://<ESP32-CAM_IP>/cam.jpg`.
2. Raspberry Pi processes images and publishes interpreted data.
3. Monitor MQTT topics for real-time readings.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure ESP32-CAM and Raspberry Pi are connected to the same network.
- Verify correct configuration of WiFi credentials and MQTT broker settings.
- Check system logs and debug messages for errors.
